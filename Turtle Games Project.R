# Assignment template

## Scenario
## You are a data analyst working for Turtle Games, a game manufacturer and 
## retailer. They manufacture and sell their own products, along with sourcing
## and selling products manufactured by other companies. Their product range 
## includes books, board games, video games and toys. They have a global 
## customer base and have a business objective of improving overall sales 
##performance by utilising customer trends. 

## In particular, Turtle Games wants to understand:
## - how customers accumulate loyalty points (Week 1)
## - how useful are remuneration and spending scores data (Week 2)
## - can social data (e.g. customer reviews) be used in marketing 
##     campaigns (Week 3)
## - what is the impact on sales per product (Week 4)
## - the reliability of the data (e.g. normal distribution, Skewness, Kurtosis)
##     (Week 5)
## - if there is any possible relationship(s) in sales between North America,
##     Europe, and global sales (Week 6).

# Week 4 assignment: EDA using R

## The sales department of Turtle games prefers R to Python. As you can perform
## data analysis in R, you will explore and prepare the data set for analysis by
## utilising basic statistics and plots. Note that you will use this data set 
## in future modules as well and it is, therefore, strongly encouraged to first
## clean the data as per provided guidelines and then save a copy of the clean 
## data for future use.

# Instructions
# 1. Load and explore the data.
##  - Remove redundant columns (Ranking, Year, Genre, Publisher) by creating 
##      a subset of the data frame.
##  - Create a summary of the new data frame.
# 2. Create plots to review and determine insights into data set.
##  - Create scatterplots, histograms and boxplots to gain insights into
##      the Sales data.
##  - Note your observations and diagrams that could be used to provide
##      insights to the business.
# 3. Include your insights and observations.

## 2a) Scatterplots
# Create various scatterplots.

qplot(NA_Sales, EU_Sales, colour= Platform, data=sales2, geom=c('point', 'jitter'))

# The graph depicting the overall global sales trends provided the most 
# significant insight into product sales, as it closely resembled the regional 
# versions. Therefore, it was enhanced with titles and other elements for 
# inclusion in the report.
qplot(Product, Global_Sales, data=sales2, colour=Product) +
  ggtitle("Global Sales by Product Number") +
  ylab("Global Sales (million Â£)") + 
  xlab("Product Number") + 
  theme_minimal()

## 2b) Histograms
# Create histograms.
qplot(NA_Sales, data=sales2)
qplot(EU_Sales, data=sales2)
qplot(Global_Sales, data=sales2)
qplot(Product, data=sales2)
qplot(Platform, data=sales2)

# I found the histograms ineffective for analysing the data because the sales 
# figures were clustered around similar values, compounded by the varying number 
# of products and platforms.

## 2c) Boxplots
# Create boxplots.
qplot(Product, NA_Sales, data=sales2, geom='boxplot')
qplot(Product, EU_Sales, data=sales2, geom='boxplot')
qplot(Product, Global_Sales, data=sales2, geom='boxplot')
qplot(Product, Platform, data=sales2, geom='boxplot')
qplot(Product, NA_Sales, data=sales2, geom='boxplot', colour=Platform)

# The boxplots also didn't offer much visually for explaining data to 
# stakeholders, apart from indicating products that significantly outsell 
# others, a point already evident in the refined scatterplot mentioned earlier.

###############################################################################

# 3. Observations and insights

## Your observations and insights here ......

# From the scatterplots created on a regional and global level, product sales are 
# larger for the products with smaller unique codes. There are slight variances 
# between North America and Europe, but by and large, products with codes under 
# 5000 are generating most of the sales. This is particularly evident when
# examining the global sales visualization. Different platforms show varying
# sales figures, with a few outliers depending on the region and product.

# The histograms illustrate that North American sales far outweigh sales in Europe.
# One product sells over 34 million copies, while most products sell between
# 0 and 10 million copies, compared to 0-5 million in Europe. However, Europe 
# does have the same biggest seller as North America, coming in at just under 
# 24 million copies. This clearly indicates that certain products outsell others
# significantly. Overall, X360, PS3, PC, and Wii were the best-performing platforms.

# The boxplots reinforce the aforementioned observations. The bulk of the products
# sell within a larger range in North America than in Europe, with significant
# outliers far outperforming those with much larger sales.

# With a vast number of products, it would be beneficial to delve into them at a
# granular level, especially those at either end of the sales spectrum. Importantly,
# products not selling should be reassessed for their value on the sales list,
# and the best sellers leveraged to create more sales. It would also be interesting
# to investigate if large regional differences in product sales can be realigned by
# discovering the reasons for the disparities and leveraging the positives from
# high sales in one region to increase sales in the other.

# 5. Observations and insights
# Your observations and insights here...
# When reviewing the sales data further, a consistent pattern emerged: 
# lower product numbers correlated with better sales figures, and North American 
# sales consistently surpassed those of the EU. Visualizing the data with 352 
# products proved challenging; histograms, boxplots, and bar plots proved 
# ineffectual as the data was difficult to interpret. While boxplots did reveal 
# a significant number of outliers, this was more clearly depicted in 
# scatterplots, providing a better understanding of sales trends.

# The Shapiro-Wilk tests conducted on EU_Sales, NA_Sales, and Global_Sales all 
# suggest non-normal distributions. This had already bee alluded to via the 
# Q-Q plots that had been conducted. Positive skewness values and high kurtosis 
# values further indicated right-skewed distributions and heavy tails, 
# respectively, for all three sales figures. As expected, there is a correlation 
# among sales figures for different regions and global sales, but not with the 
# products themselves.

# The top products from each region were also analysed to assess performance 
# across different areas. While only a small number of products performed poorly, 
# they warrant investigation to ensure cost-effectiveness in the market. The 
# best sellers should also be investigated for insight into their popularity.
# Additionally, it became evident that certain products outsold their counterparts 
# in either the EU or NA regions. Therefore, the data was compiled to identify 
# products with the greatest disparities in sales. These findings will be further 
# examined to understand the reasons behind such differences and explore how 
# strategies that contributed to high sales in one region can potentially boost 
# sales in the counterpart region.

# It should also be noted that sales in other global regions should be assessed 
# and categorized, as any improvement in market share would be beneficial. 
# Currently, global sales total 1877.81 million, while North America and the 
# EU together total 885.62 and 578.61 million, respectively, amount to a 
# collective total of 1464.23 million. This leaves 413.58 million sold outside 
# of these regions. By analyzing this data, we can identify which regions are 
# experiencing increasing sales and determine how to further enhance those markets. 
# Conversely, we can evaluate regions that are not showing improvement to 
# understand the underlying reasons and make changes to improve sales.

# Week 6 assignment: Making recommendations to the business using R

## The sales department wants to better understand if there is any relationship
## between North America, Europe, and global sales. Therefore, you need to
## investigate any possible relationship(s) in the sales data by creating a 
## simple and multiple linear regression model. Based on the models and your
## previous analysis (Weeks 1-5), you will then provide recommendations to 
## Turtle Games based on:
##   - Do you have confidence in the models based on goodness of fit and
##        accuracy of predictions?
##   - What would your suggestions and recommendations be to the business?
##   - If needed, how would you improve the model(s)?
##   - Explain your answers.

# Instructions
# 1. Load and explore the data.
##  - Continue to use the data frame that you prepared in the Week 5 assignment. 
# 2. Create a simple linear regression model.
##  - Determine the correlation between the sales columns.
##  - View the output.
##  - Create plots to view the linear regression.
# 3. Create a multiple linear regression model
##  - Select only the numeric columns.
##  - Determine the correlation between the sales columns.
##  - View the output.
# 4. Predict global sales based on provided values. Compare your prediction to
#      the observed value(s).

# 5. Observations and insights
# North American sales exhibited a slightly stronger positive correlation with 
# global sales compared to EU sales, standing at 93% and 88% respectively. 
# Both correlations denote strong relationships. Additionally, both regions 
# demonstrated a good fit in a simple linear regression model, with coefficients 
# of determination (R^2) at 87% and 77% for North American and EU sales 
# respectively. These findings suggest that sales from both regions serve as 
# reliable predictors for global sales.

# In the context of multiple linear regression, Model A emerged as the chosen 
# model, explaining 97% of the variability. Subsequent models yielded similar 
# results, hovering around the 97% mark, with differences within 0.5% of each 
# other. Given the nature of sales observations and the substantial correlation 
# between sales variables, it may not be necessary to include all numeric columns.

# Following the generation of predictions from Model A, it becomes evident that 
# the model overestimates global sales for four of the observations, ranging 
# between 5% to 17%. While the model demonstrates a high degree of fit, 
# indicated by the R^2 value of 0.99, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) remains 
# relatively low at 2.21, reflecting good performance. However, the Mean 
# Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) returns a slightly high result, just over 10%. 
# While not catastrophic, it suggests that the model may not achieve the desired 
# level of accuracy, as evidenced by the aforementioned results.
